# Crafting Tool for Your ML/RL Experiments with Docker

## Installation
Simply install it from PyPI using the following command:
```shell
pip install crafting
```

If you encounter any issues after the installation, such as receiving a `command not found` error, try adding the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file:
```shell
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

This will ensure that the `crafting` command is accessible from anywhere in your terminal.
